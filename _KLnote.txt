Some syntax

\bf, \it
        - make the heading bold or italic,

\scshape
        - small capitals,

\small, \normalsize, \large, \Large, \LARGE, \huge, \Huge
        - set the font size,

\rmfamily, \sffamily, \ttfamily 
        - set the font type to serifed, san serifed or typewriter respectively.
        

\hfill command tells LaTeX to fill as much space as possible and so pushes the second argument (#2) to the right of the page
